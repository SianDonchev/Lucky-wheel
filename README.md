# Lucky Wheel Project

## Concept

The 'Lucky Wheel' project brings a novel and exciting twist to the traditional shopping experience. It is a platform where influencers, businesses, and enterprises can engage with users by listing various offers and prizes. The central feature is a virtual 'Wheel of Luck' where users can place these offers, assigning a specific percentage chance to each. The intriguing catch? The higher the probability a user assigns to winning a prize, the higher the cost - but with the potential benefit of securing coveted items at a fraction of their value. It's a game of chance and strategy, offering a unique way for users to possibly purchase prizes for less.
